# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The project is aimed to identify credit card customers who are at a higher risk of churning.

Approach involves developing a Python package for a machine learning project that adheres to coding standards (PEP8) and best practices in software engineering. 

This package will emphasize modularity, thorough documentation, and comprehensive testing.

Furthermore, this Python package will offer the versatility of being run interactively or through a command-line interface (CLI), ensuring that users can choose the most convenient way to utilize the churn prediction functionality.

## Files and data description
The project has the following directory architecture:
- Folders
    - Data -->  Dataset for analysis
    - eda       --> contains output of the data exploration
    - results   --> contains the dataset in csv format
    - images        --> contains model scores, confusion matrix, ROC curve
    - models        --> contains saved models in .pkl format
    - logs          --> log generated druing testing of library.py file

- project files 
    - churn_library.py
    - churn_notebook.ipnyb
    - requirements.txt
    - churn_script_logging_and_tests.py


## Running Files
- The project should be executed with required packages that are provided in the requirements.txt file
- To run the project, execute the script `python churn_library.py` from the project folder
- Alternatively, the project can be executed using the jupyter notebook for a step-by-step approach
- The project script `churn_library.py` can be tested using `ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py`
